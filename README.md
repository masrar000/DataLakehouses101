This repository is for Big Data &amp; Scalable Computation (DSE I2450). It contains files for our final project on data warehouses, lakes, and lakehouses.

## <img src='https://www.svgrepo.com/show/229886/idea.svg' style="height: 30px; margin: 5px; padding: 5px"/>  Key Features




  - Notebook tutorials that walk through building a machine learning pipeline on Databricks while showcasing how lakehouse storage and functionality can be used in the process.
  - Supplementary documentation to provide more information on tasks and concepts mentioned in the notebooks.
  - A self-contained tutorial with links to external resources for interested users.

```
### How to Use 
  - You can work through each notebook on its own. 
  - Tutorials walk through different aspects of the Databricks Lakehouse infrastructure and how it can be integrated into machine learning pipelines.
  - Some tutorials contain open-ended and coding tasks.
    -  When a coding task is given, the solution is also provided.
  -  External documentation and more information are linked wherever necessary.
