This repository is for Big Data &amp; Scalable Computation (DSE I2450). It contains files for our final project on data warehouses, lakes, and lakehouses.

## <img src='https://www.svgrepo.com/show/229886/idea.svg' style="height: 30px; margin: 5px; padding: 5px"/>  Key Features




  - Notebook tutorials that walk through processing data with Delta Tables in Databricks.
  - Our main goal is to showcase how lakehouse storage and functionality can be used when building pipelines for data processing and machine learning.
  - Supplementary documentation to provide more information on tasks and concepts mentioned in the notebooks.
  - A self-contained tutorial with links to external resources for interested users.

### Repo Structure
```bash
├── Data Processing with Delta Lakes       # Contains tutorials for all things data (data cleaning, EDA, ETL processes, etc.) 
│   ├── Data_cleaning_&_EDA.ipynb          # Walks through Delta Tables for data cleaning and EDA 
│   ├── quickstart_sales_retail.ipynb      # Gives an overview of multiple data tasks and ETL processes
│   ├── Delta_Lake_Tutorial.ipynb          # Highlights what aspects of Delta Lake separate it from traditional data lakes. 
├── data                                   # Contains data files used in tutorials 
├── docs                                   # Documentation files
├── figures                            
```
### How to Use 
  - You can work through each notebook on its own. 
  - Tutorials walk through different aspects of the Databricks Lakehouse infrastructure. Some present practical applications of Delta Tables while others introduce important background information. 
  - Some tutorials contain open-ended and coding tasks.
    -  When a coding task is given, the solution is also provided.
  -  External documentation and more information are linked wherever necessary.
